                        <p class="text-white mb-5"> Autocracies have once again become the global majority. The devastation in the cities of Ukraine to the war-torn lands of Syria exemplifies the universal struggle for democracy. In examining and addressing this disturbing global trend, the history of Latin America. However, it is crucial to look at our own biases and the lens with which we perceive the world. I implore you to approach the following information with the consideration of the powerful presence of a “coloniality of power” and some inhibition towards an overzealous effort to point at Western influence. We must depart from ever-changing, black and white notions of good and bad systems of governance which, despite our best efforts, often retain Western political vocabulary. Beyond the stories of Western political interference and oppressive regimes is the story of regular people, their strengths and flaws, and the pursuit of freedom.</p>

                            <h6 class="text-white mb-4">A BALANCING ACT</h6><
                            <p class="text-white">September 11, 1973 marked the emergence of the infamous Pinochet regime and the beginning of an era of atrocities and terror. For years leading up to the coup, the United States had vested interest in preventing leftist movements in Chile. While the existence of an “Invisible Blockade” to destabilize the Chilean economy prior to the coup continues to be widely debated, the United States’ concerted efforts to supplant Allende as President cannot be denied. Between the 1970 election and the 1973 coup d’état, the CIA spent eight million dollars to nearly any establishment opposing Allende (Davis-Hamel). Chile’s remarkable status among its Latin American peers made it the prime subject for increased economic relations between the United States and Latin America. Then, on that September 11th, in a conjoined effort by the Navy, Air Force, National Police, and Army, leaders of the armed forces and National Police swiftly deposed President Salvador Allende and installed Pinochet as the President of the Government Junta of Chile.</p>
                            <p class="text-white">Pinochet’s rule was marked by economic turmoil, which would serve as the impetus for a number of neoliberal reforms that would continue to plague the country to this day. During the start of the regime, Pinochet faced massive inflation and sought to mitigate the economic decline with free-market reforms and the installation of American-educated Chilean economists, called “Chicago Boys”, in Pinochet’s military government. The subsequent years saw greater focus on attracting foreign investment, an expansion in the export sector, and a reduction in the public sector, ushering in an era defined by a dominant business class and an economy susceptible to fluctuations in the global market. The economic growth enabled Pinochet to introduce his constitution. This constitution, which remains in effect today, gave greater control over economic development of the country to the private sector and has made it exceedingly difficult to combat neoliberalism (Chile 1980 Constitution).</p>
                            <p class="text-white">The political turmoil in Chile offers a story about the dangers of political polarization. First, however, a recognition that examinations into Latin American history and politics require a vastly different lens than other countries is necessary to understanding this story. Similarly to Stuart Hall’s concept of “the West and the rest”, the growing popularity of left-leaning ideologies in the United States has created another construct based on a new Western dichotomy (Hall). Aside from the prominent narrative of the United States’ installation of dictators and oppressive regimes, Allende’s domestic economic policies and political balancing act was generally poor prior to his removal. Furthermore, his false promises of a socialist revolution in an increasingly elitist democratic state was a large part of Chile’s economic collapse. The polarized environment between the left, the socialist party, and the right made it impossible for Allende to legislate through congress and was also unimpeachable due to the lack of a political majority (Chakrabarti & Sutherland). Polarization of political parties results in economic woes, which becomes the perfect breeding ground for further polarization. Despite more than a hundred years of democratic governance, Chile was unable to withstand the repercussions of political polarization. Chile’s story highlights the necessity to maintain a unified state in upholding equality and democracy.</p>

                            <h6 class="text-white mb-4">DECEPTION</h6><
                            <p class="text-white">Unlike Chile and a number of their Latin American neighbors, the universalization of basic education in Brazil was achieved relatively late. On the other hand, Brazil’s public institutions were meritocratic and possessed high social prestige. Naturally, Brazil’s intellectuals often overlapped with the dominant class and the state’s interest often aligned with the interests of the dominant class (Medeiros & Trebat). The 2002 presidential election saw a glimpse of the reversal of this trend with the victory of Workers’ Party (PT) candidate Luis Inácio Lula da Silva. His presidency saw the emergence of a new coalition that considered the interests of the working class. Lula’s high levels of popular approval earned the PT an enormous amount of popularity and power. After Lula’s presidency, the PT took advantage of their popularity to solidify their connections with big business and the use of supply-side policy making increased (Ramírez). As a result, conflicts emerged between workers and large businesses during the significant fall in output after 2010.</p>
                            <p class="text-white">Lula’s popularity was vital in sustaining the PT and bringing together the leadership and the grassroots. His image of being “salt-of-the-earth’ due to his upbringing in an authoritarian society lends a certain legitimacy to the party’s socialist vision. His departure from office saw the division between the leadership and the grassroots as the party transitioned to a more social-democratic practice (Solidarity). The Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST), despite their strong ties to the PT since their founding, has also expressed disillusionment with the PT (Stronzake & Wolford). Maintaining democracy requires a battle on two fronts: institutional lawmaking and local solidarity movements. Legislators who abuse the public’s trust in their legislative powers and ethics promotes a return to a consolidated power held by the elite. Grassroots organizations with little political power and insufficient resources may turn to focus on fulfilling the desires of their donors rather than the objectives of the movement. The existence of newer grassroots movements like the MST in a multiparty governing system allows for a recurring reminder of the needs of the people in political institutions. While corruption and succumbence to bureaucracy are inevitable, establishing a system that empowers the emergence of movements to challenge the ineffectual establishment is an important task in setting the foundation for a democratic society.</p>

                            <h6 class="text-white mb-4">REVOLUTION</h6>
                            <p class="text-white">For over two years, Venezuela was teetering on the edge of a civil war. The public sector and the majority of media outlets rallied against President Hugo Chávez and in April 2002, a coup d’état successfully removed Chávez from the presidency for thirty-six hours. Two years of instability and unrest is a monumental encumbrance to overcome, yet Chávez remained president until 2013. What Chávez had done was implement massive social spending and mobilized his supporters against opponents for tradition and private media. To maintain this surge in popularity, the Chávez government continued to pour enormous resources into cooperatives, communal councils, community media, and many other participatory initiatives (La Botz). However, this amounted to a very poor foundation upon which Venezuelan prosperity was built upon. Despite the massive social spending, the Chávez government possessed a more concealed neoliberal side in supporting foreign coal mining despite protests by local indigenous groups.</p>
                            <p class="text-white">While neoliberalism has been a common blanket explanation for the instability seen in most Latin American countries, Venezuela exemplifies a fundamental issue with socialist thought. While the economics of socialism are capable of achieving an unprecedented level of social equality and equity, the politics of socialism and its inherent lack of self-awareness is often its failure. While Venezuela cannot be directly related to the communist regimes of the Soviet Union and China, the manner in which these governments came to power demonstrates this failure of socialist politics. Vladimir Lenin is infamous for his “smash the state” sentiments. His revolution and destruction of existing institutions did nothing to free the people of Russia and, when workers of Kronstadt rebelled in 1921, Lenin chose to brutally repress the rebellion. In China, Mao’s “cultural revolution” saw the public humiliation or execution of state officials and seemed primarily focused on disparaging capitalism. Without knowledge of the proper vocabulary and the absence of strong institutional mechanisms, revolutionaries remain revolutionaries after toppling the existing institution (Smilde). Venezuela highlights the necessity of a politically aware people who will seek revolution not to “smash the state”, but to offer their fellow citizens a chance at liberation.</p>
